This is a class project completed with R. 
I used a combination of exploratory data analysis, statistical analysis, 
and classification algorithms for inferencial analysis on students job placement prospect after graduation. 
I analyzed the performance of some classification algorithm and evaluated them using confusion matrix and ROC curve.
The project report is attached as a pdf file along with the code implementation.
